# Gameplay
After compiling the program, you will see 4x4 plain with one number. By using one of the four commands (left, right, up, down), you will be able to slide all squares in that direction. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. Every turn, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. If you have no more space for a new tile and you can't swipe in any direction, you lose.
